        Inline Elements:
        Inline elements are those that don't start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. 
        They're often used within block-level elements. 
        Here are some common inline elements:
        1) <span>: A generic inline container.
        2) <a>: Creates hyperlinks.
        3) <strong> and <em>: Used for text styling (bold and italic).

        Block Elements:
        Block elements, on the other hand, start on a new line and take up the full available width. 
        They're often used to create the structure and layout of a web page. 
        Here are some common block elements:
        1) <div>: A generic block-level container.
        2) <p>: Defines paragraphs.
        3) <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc.: Headings with varying levels of importance.
        4) <ul>, <ol>, and <li>: Used for creating lists.
        5) <section> and <article>: Used for structuring the content.
