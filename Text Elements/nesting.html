        <strong> element is nested inside the <p> element,
        <p> element is nested inside the <body> element,
        <body> element is nested inside the <html> element.

        Nesting is like elements having some sort of relationship.

        But there are certain things that we woudn't really nest.
        e.g. We wouldn't put a paragraph inside of another paragraph. (NOT VALID HTML)
