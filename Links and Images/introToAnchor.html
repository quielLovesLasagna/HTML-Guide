    <!-- 
        2 information that every link needs:
        1) Link Text: What does the link say?
        2) Destination: Where does the link take you to?
     -->

    <!-- 
        Use the anchor element to create hyperlinks
        to other webpages and documents.

        An anchor element is an inline element.

        In the example below, the:
        Link text is: Go To Reddit,
        Destination: https://www.reddit.com/

        Attributes: Everything inside the opening tag of an element after the "a".
        Attributes control an elements behavior, it's like a property
        that we provide to an element.

        The attribute in this case, is the href attribute.
        href is where the location of a link should be, where a user 
        should go when they click this/a link. 
    -->
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Go To Reddit</a>
