    <!--
        We can also link directly to other HTML documents
        by referencing them using a relative path.

        We can do with links (<a>) is create an anchor element
        that links to a relative location,
        meaning: instead of a website that someone else has hosted,
        like Reddit or Facebook or something like that.
        We could link to another one of our own HTML documents/another
        one of our resources.

        In the example below, I am using the first HTML file that I made
        earlier which is about introduction to anchor element, as a reference.
        If a user links on the link below, the user will be transfered to another HTML
        document which is Introduction TO Anchor Element.

        Note: These two HTML file (the one this file is in right now and the one that
        I made earlier) is on the same folder. It's important to note this because
        if I move the Intro To Anchor Element file to other folder, then I'll
        have to use a different reference, a different way of referring to this document,
        a different path. I am going to reference a link below for you to learn about this.
