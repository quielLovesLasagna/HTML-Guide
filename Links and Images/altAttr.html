        alt: this is for alternate text.
        Alt is not gonna be displayed but it's there in the event
        that the image can't be found or it can't load and it's also
        there for accessibility purposes. It should hold a short description of
        the image so that somebody using a screen reader who is visually impaired
        will have an idea as to what the image is.

        All images should have an alt text, except for one type of image, one situation:
        images that don't provide anything (just for displays). If you have images
        that does not mean anything or just for displays, you can set the alt
        attribute to empty quotes alt="" which is still different than having
        no alt attribute.
