        Divs are generic container that have no
        inherent meaning. They are used to group
        content together for styling.

        It is like a <span></span> in the sense 
        that it's a generic container. But unlike
        the span, it takes up a whole block of space.
        It's a box, it's not an inline element like
        a span.

        We <div> for situations where we want to group
        content together to later style it. We use it to
        form groups of content where there's no better 
        elements that we would use to wrap that content.

        See example below and style above.

  <div class="form-container">
    <form action="">
      <div class="username-container">
        <label for="username">Username</label>
        <input type="text" name="username" id="username" required />
      </div>
      <div class="password-container">
        <label for="password">Password</label>
        <input type="password" name="password" id="password" required />
      </div>
      <button>Log In</button>
