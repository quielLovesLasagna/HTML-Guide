        Spans are generic inline elements.
        They have no special meaning but can be
        styled later using CSS. Span is useful 
        when it comes to styling cotent.

        Any time you have text content that you 
        want to style somewhat differently from 
        the surrounding text content, would be a good
        use case for <span>.

        Assuming that it doesn't make more sense to use
        <strong> or <em>, etc...

        The way we use spans is we'll have a bunch of
        spans across a page or a chunk of text that we
        want to style.

        You can add a class="" attribute to a span
        class is just like an id (label) but a concept of a
        class is that it's repeated, an ID can only occur once 
        (unique to each element). A class is something that we
        constantly refer back to and duplicate all over the place.
        You can use the class attribute to target the labelled element
        and style the elemen in CSS.

        You should only use <span> when there is no better
        inline element that suits your needs like <strong>,
        <em>, <b>, etc.... or whatever you're trying to
        accomplish. If there's more meaningful element, you
        can use that. If not, you can use the span to wrap
        around text content and then style it in some way
        that you want, often by using a class and then CSS. 
            
        Look at the example below and the <style> above.
