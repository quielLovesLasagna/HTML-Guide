        <video src=""></video>
        By default the video does not do anything,
        it does not play.

        We can add the following attributes to control
        the video:

        constrols => allows the user to have control
        over the video

        autoplay => autoplays the video when the page loads.
        This attribute works depending on the browser. In chrome, it won't autoplay.
        You can control this using JavaScript. UNLESS! the video is muted ;)
        So, it can only auto play if the video is already muted when the page loads.

        muted => mutes the video.

        Additionally, if you have sound in a video and it's not muted, definitely
        add the controls.

        loop => loops the video.

        Just like the audio, you can add text between <video>...content...</video>
        but it won't be displayed/rendered unless that video can't load or the browser
        does not recognize a video element.

        Instead of adding the src attribute to the video element, one fancier thing you can do is
        actually nest a source element inside the video.
        <source> => does not have a closing tag. This allows us to specify multiple files types.
        Let's say you have twp videos with the file type of .webm and .mp4, not all browsers
        will support .webm, so if the browser does, it will use the source with .webm, if it does
        not, it will keep moving until it finds a source that it can handle/that it recognize.

        You can also add the type attribute inside the source element.
        It is used to specify the media type (MIME type) of the resource 
        you are linking to. It tells the browser what kind of media the 
        linked file is, like an image, audio, or video.

        You can also do this source element thing to audio element if you
        want to provide multiple sources of the audio with different format.
