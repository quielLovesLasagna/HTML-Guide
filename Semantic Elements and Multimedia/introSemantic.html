    <!-- 
        Semantic Markup is a fancy way of saying that
        when you write HTML, your tags should be meaningful.
        
        The HTML tags "say" something about the meaning of
        their content.

        They are still just containers. They don't know
        anything. You won't see them unless you style them.
        They behave exactly the same as a div, but they provide
        meaning.
        
        Benefits:
        1) Accessibility. It's way more accessible and screen
        reader friendly.
        2) Search Engines. When code is crawling across your
        web pages, if it is marked up using semantic elements.
        Let's take Google's web spider, for example, it's able to
        identify what your website means.
        3) Developer Sanity. It's a lot easier to work on a web page
        where semantic elements are present. 

        Semantic elements don't change anything in terms of the 
        behavior or the appearanve of the web page. It's all 
        about using these other elements to improve accessibility.

        We used a span to make a heading, which means absolutely
        nothing.

        You can also change the font-size of the h1
        but unlike using span to make a heading, using
        an h1 is more meaningful.

        The span means nothing, while the h1 does.
