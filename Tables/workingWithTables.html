    <!-- 
        Elements involved in creating table:
        1) <table>
        2) <thead>
        3) <tr>
        4) <th>
        5) <tbody>
        6) <td> and more...
    -->

    <!-- 
        3 most important elements:
        1) <table>
        2) <tr>
        3) <td>
    -->

    <!-- 
      First thing we always have to do when creating a table
      is use the parent table element.

      Second, for every row in the table, we use a <tr> element.
      In the example below, we have 3 rows. Every row is it's
      own row horizontally.
        
      Any content is then going to be put inside of <td> elements.
      <td> is for tables data cell. A single <td> represents a single
      cell in the table. In our example below we have Avatar is one <td>
      and then another <td> and they are both in the same row. And then we 
      repeat the process for the next table row.   
    -->
    <h1>Example</h1>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Avatar</td>
        <td>$123,456,789</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Avengers: Endgame</td>
        <td>$123,456,789</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Titanic</td>
        <td>$123,456,789</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Another Example</h2>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>The Shawshank Redemption</td>
        <td>1994</td>
        <td>9.2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>The Godfather</td>
        <td>1972</td>
        <td>9.2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>The Dark Knight</td>
        <td>2008</td>
        <td>9.0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>The Godfather II</td>
        <td>1974</td>
        <td>9.0</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
