        <fieldset> this is not an input, it is
        not a form control. Instead, it's actually
        something we use to group together form controls.

        An example of this is when you  have radio input types
        which are usually grouped, and you want to have some 
        sort of overarching label to explain what the user is selecting.

        We can then add a <legend></legend> element right inside the fieldset.
        The legend element is going to explain what the grouping is for.
        It's basically a label or a caption for the fieldset.
        
        Doing this will be better for users who are using screen reader.

        What's actually cool about this is that we can disable all of the 
        elements (inputs) at once. If we want to totally disable the entire inputs,
        you can do: <fieldset disabled>...inputs...</fieldset>
    -->
    <h1>Fieldset and Legends</h1>
    <form action="">
      <fieldset disabled>
        <legend>Pick Your Shirt Size</legend>
        <div>
          <input type="radio" id="small" name="size" value="s" />
          <label for="small">Small</label>
        </div>
        <div>
          <input type="radio" id="medium" name="size" value="m" />
          <label for="medium">Medium</label>
        </div>
        <div>
          <input type="radio" id="large" name="size" value="l" />
          <label for="large">Large</label>
        </div>
        <button>Submit</button>
