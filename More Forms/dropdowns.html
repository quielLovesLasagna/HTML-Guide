    <title>Making Dropdowns with Select and Options</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- 
        selects is it's own element, it is not a type
        of input. We use selects to create a dropdown 
        select menu with a bunch of options.

        The way we use this is by using two elements together.
        The <selects></selects> element wraps around one or more
        <option></option> element. Each option element will represent
        one of those options from the list that you can select.

        If you want to have one of the options pre selected,
        you can use the "selected" attribute on one of those options.
        The selected is similar to required and checked where you don't
        set it equal to anything.

    <h1>Selects</h1>
    <form action="">
      <div>
        <label for="skillevel">Select your skill level</label>
        <select name="skillevel" id="skillevel">
          <option value="1">Level 1 - Beginner</option>
          <option value="2" selected>Level 2 - Intermediate</option>
          <option value="3">Level 3 - Expert</option>
        </select>
      </div>
      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
    <!-- 
        IN THE CASE IF YOU DID NOT SET THE VALUE ATTRIBUTE TO OPTION ELEMENT:
        If you submit the form it will look like this;
        skillevel=Level+2+-+Intermediate
        It just took the value from inside the option tags (the text content)

        IN THE CASE IF YOU SET THE VALUE ATTRIBUTE TO OPTION ELEMENT:
        We can add the value attribute to each option element and whatever
        value we specify will be sent as the corresponding value. That makes it easier 
        on the server side when we submit the form.
