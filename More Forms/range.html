        <input type="range" min="0" max="11" />
        Use type="range" to create a range input (slider)
        The range input is basically a numeric sllider.

        From Left to right, it's a slider that you're moving around
        from what min value to what max value.

        range type input does not tell you where you are at the range of
        min and max.

        Use range type input for things where precision doesn't really
        matter or there is a sliding scale and a user is contantly adapting
        like volume.

        By default, the volume will start at the middle. 
        You can also control the initial value of the range by doing:
        value="your initial value"

        You can also set a step="" this means that every
        time you move the slider, it will step by the value you
        assign to the step attribute.

        NOTE: Only use these attributes to control the range
        in specific cases. Only use the input type range in cases
        where precision does not matter.

        See the code below
    -->
    <h1>Input Range</h1>
    <form action="">
      <div>
        <label for="volume">Select Volume</label>
        <input
          type="range"
          min="0"
          max="10"
          id="volume"
          name="volume"
          value="2"
        />
        <button>Submit</button>
      </div>
      <!-- 
        If you submit the form, you'll see at the URl that the 
        number is sent under the name, which in this case is
        volume.

        e.g.: volume=6
      -->
