    <!-- 
        Use the required attribute to mark an
        input as... required!
        <input type="password" required />

        If you want to force a value to be present in
        some sort of input, you can use the required attrbute

        We don't set the required attribute to anything.

        If the input element that has the required attribute is
        blank and user tries to submit the form, it will complain
        and say something like: Please fill out this field. 

        If we don't use the required attribute,
        then our input is just optional.
