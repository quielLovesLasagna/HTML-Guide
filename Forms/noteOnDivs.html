    <!-- 
        One quick note about forms sort of adjacent to forms is
        there's a pattern you'll frequently see in forms, which is
        to group/wrap together a label with its corresponding input
        in another element, and that element often is something called 
        <div>.

        <div></div> is just like a box/container that you can use to
        group content together. And then with CSS you could later style
        the div. A <div> is a block element.

  <h1>Divs</h1>
  <form action="">
    <div>
      <label for="username">Username:</label>
      <input type="text" id="username" placeholder="Username" required />
    </div>
    <div>
      <label for="password">Password:</label>
      <input type="password" id="password" placeholder="password" required />
    </div>
    <button>Submit</button>
  </form>
