        1) email type input is just like a text input but there is an
        important distinction. (we can only notice the distinction if
        the input is inside a form). The reason we put email type input
        sinde a form element is because there is some validation on an
        email input that is going to verify that I have an email shaped value
        in the input when I try and submit the form.
        If I don't have an email shaped value, it complains to me like:
        Please include an @ sign in the email address.
        This is not checking if it's a valid email. It's very simple, but it's
        at least doing some checks.

        One way to get away with this checks to to actually submit the form, is by
        leaving the input empty (we will learn how to handle this later)

        2) url type input. The idea of email is the same with URl where there's checking.

        3) number type input, if you letter characters in this input, it will not
        let you, you can only type numbers in number type input
