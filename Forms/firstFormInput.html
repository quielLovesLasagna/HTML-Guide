        The input element is extreemely versatile.
        set type="text" to create a standard text input.
        Like the <a> element, it has no closing tag, which
        means this is a void element.
        
        We can make many many type of inputs by changing the type attribute.

        The first basic type of an input field is a text input.
        <input type="text">

        Similar to the text input type, we also have password input.
        the password input is also a text field but when you type something
        in that input, you can't see the text that you are typing.
        All the text, all the characters just show up as dots.

        Input elements are inline elements.

        placeholder attribute: this allows us to specify placeholder text
        that will show up in the input before user starts typing, and it
        will go away when a user types.
