        Match a label element to a form control using the
        "for" attribute. It must match the id attribute on
        an input (see above)

        In the previous topics, we've seen that we can use placeholder
        attribute to add a placeholder text in an input.
        BUT
        We should always properly label our inputs using the label
        element. The reason for this has to do with accessbility.
        By properly labeling every form control, we can ensure that
        screen readers and users who are using screen readers have a
        better experience with our inputs.
        
        One way to know that you are properly labelling your inputs is:
        if you click on the label text, it will automatically focus
        in that input. This is actually great because now, both the label element
        and the input element is connected.
