        If the button is outside of the form, it will not do
        anything. The button will only submit the form if it is
        inside the form element.

        As I said earlier, the default type/behavior of buttons is "submit".
        If you set the type of a button to "button", it will not submit the form
        even if it is inside the form element, it does not act as a submit button
        because it's not, it's type is just "button".

        Another way of making a button, a submission button, which is actually use
        to use the input element:
        <input type="submit" />
        It works similarly with button but what's annoying is if I want to change the
        text on it, then I have to use another attribute called value
        <input type="submit" value="Log Me In" />
        by doing this, it will change the text and not it will say Log Me In.
        using input element to make a button is valid but it's just a little more
        confusing to remember because to have to use the value attribute to change
        the text instead of just using a regular button and if you want to change
        the text, you just have to change the text in the middle.

    <h1>Basic Forms</h1>
    <form action="/login">
      <input type="text" placeholder="Username" />
      <input type="password" placeholder="Password" />
      <input type="submit" value="Log Me In" />
      <button>Log Me In</button>
    </form>
    <button>Does not work</button>
  </body>
