        Visually, we can't see the "form" but it does do something that is very
        important in a typical web application:
        1) It holds a bunch of form controls,
        inputs, buttons, checkboxes, all that stuff. It groups them together.

        2) When that form is submitted, it will send that data somewhere. And that's
        a critical part.

        Here's the rules of making a form:
        1) An action is going to be set to some URl/some location where the form data
        will be sent to.
        2) Method attribute, this is the type pf HTTP request that the form will submit.

        To submit the form, we can use a button element inside the form element.
        The default behavior of a button in a form is that it will submit that form.

        <form action="/signup" method="get">
            Form Controls Goes Here...
        </form>

      <button>Log Me In</button>
    </form>
    <!--
        Whatever we here for the action, the form will
        submit to that location.
